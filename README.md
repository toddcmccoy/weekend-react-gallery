# A React Image Gallery

## Description

_Duration: 14 hours_

The goal of this project was to create an image gallery representing important things in my life. This gallery allows the user to view images of my adorable pets. Once an image is clicked the image is replaced with a brief description of that image. The user also has the ability to 'like' any of the images in the gallery. The number of 'likes' is displayed under each image and is updated every time the like button is clicked.

## Installation

1. All data is store locally so there is no need to create a database for this project. 
3. Open up your editor of choice and run an `npm install`
4. Run `npm run server` in your terminal
5. Run `npm run client` in your terminal
6. The `npm run client` command will open up a new browser tab for you!
